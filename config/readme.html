    <h3 style="font-family:monospace;">Demo</h3>
    <p> This dashboard is meant to serve as a basic demonstration of the kind of queries and visualizations you can make
        with some of the data you collect with the extension.</p>
    <p>
        It's currently under development, so there might be a bug or missing feature or two.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-family:monospace;">How to query the data</h3>
    <p>The data in this dashboard primarly leverages <a href="https://quickwit.io">Quickwit</a>. Quickwit supports a
        Lucene-like query
        language (and Elasticsearch-search compatible API) which
        you can learn
        more about <a href="https://quickwit.io/docs/reference/query-language">here</a>.</p>

    <p>At the top of the dashboard you can also filter by log and trace attributes, which will automatically apply to
        the
        related dashboard visualizations.</p>
