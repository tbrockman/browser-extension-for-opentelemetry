## Features

- Instruments selected webpages to **generate logs and traces**, sent to an OTLP-compatible  of _your_ choosing
- Choose from the available automatic instrumentations (or [contribute your own](contributing.md))

  <br></br>
- Choose where and how you want it to run! Don't worry about the extension tracking every single webpage, use [match patterns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns) (ex. `https://<your-domain-here>.com/*`) to specify the pages it should run on and have access to.

  <br></br>
- No content-security policy errors! Works around typical CSP limitations by making `fetch` requests from the background script instead of the webpage
- Propagate b3 and w3c trace context to websites of your choosing (matched by regular expressions)

## Browser compatibility

This extension is compatible with [all major browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/scripting/executeScript#browser_compatibility) as of Firefox 128! ðŸŽ‰

## Security considerations

> [!WARNING]
> You probably shouldn't run this extension on webpages you don't trust

### Why?

The extension background script exports any Protobuf-encoded OTLP data that it receives from the injected content script that it's able to parse.

While some mitigations are implemented, the data can always be tampered with by any malicious Javascript running in the same context as the content script, and as such the integrity of the data cannot be guaranteed. This may result in minor frustrations like storing a bunch of garbage or worse depending on how your backend decodes Protobuf data.

So, just as a general safety measure, it's probably best if you don't allow the extension to run in untrusted pages (and you should kinda generally avoid running code in untrusted webpages if you aren't already, anyhow).

### Can it be fixed?

Probably not in the near future. Unless browsers expose telemetry themselves, there's no way for the instrumentation to both run in an isolated context as well as gather the desired data.

## Developing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tbrockman/browser-extension-for-opentelemetry
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the OpenTelemetry stack (Grafana + Quickwit + `opentelemetry--contrib`):<sup> (optional if you have your own)</sup>

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or for targetting a browser other than Chrome (the default)
pnpm dev --target=edge-mv3
```

Then, open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you're developing for Chrome, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

## Making a production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
```

or, for targeting a specific browser:

```bash
pnpm build:chrome
# or
pnpm build:safari
# or
pnpm build:edge
# or
pnpm build:firefox
```

Then, follow the same steps as with running the development server, but load the appropriate production build from the `build` directory, i.e: `build/chrome-mv3-prod`.

### Safari

Safari requires a bit of extra work. After building the extension, run the following commands to convert the extension to a an XCode project:

```bash
pnpm convert:safari
```

Then, build the extension in XCode (using the MacOS target), and enable it in Safari.

> [!NOTE]
> Safari requires extensions to be signed before they can be installed. You can either sign the extension yourself, or load it as an unsigned extension after enabling "allow unsigned extensions" in Safari's developer settings.
